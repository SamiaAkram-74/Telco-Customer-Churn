# Telco-Customer-Churn
Goal:
 To build a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn (leave a service) — helping businesses retain valuable customers through data-driven insights.
What I did:
 ✅ Loaded and preprocessed the dataset (customer_churn.csv)
 ✅ Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features
 ✅ Trained and compared multiple models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
 ✅ Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
 ✅ Handled class imbalance and implemented explainability using SHAP values and feature importance
